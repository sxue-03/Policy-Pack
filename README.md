# Policy Pack — Security Documentation

## Objective
Develop a small set of security policies and incident response documentation aligned with NIST and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks.

## Documents
- Logging and Monitoring Policy
- Incident Response Plan
- Cloud Access Control Policy
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Sheet

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Word or Markdown
- NIST SP 800-53 reference
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Excel or Power BI for risk mapping (optional)

## Skills Learned
- Policy writing and documentation
- Control mapping to NIST and MITRE frameworks
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Communication and documentation best practices

## Steps Overview
1. Draft policies based on lessons from SOC and Cloud Security Labs.
2. Align each control with a NIST category (e.g., AC, IR, AU).
3. Map detection use cases to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
4. Create a short Incident Response checklist for triage.
5. Export all policies and mapping to your Policy-Pack repository.

## Results
- Completed three concise policies aligned with industry standards.
- Created MITRE ATT&CK mapping for Wazuh and Azure detections.
- Produced a repeatable IR workflow for future incidents.

## Next Steps
- Expand policy coverage (vulnerability management, backup policy).
- Add real detection-to-policy linkage (e.g., Event ID → ATT&CK technique).
- Turn policies into compliance templates for audits.
